# What's it? 
This is a page through the 'Web Development 101' course at [The Odin Project](https://github.com/Saranoya/odin/tree/master/html_css/google/homepage). 

# What I learned?
In this project I have used HTML and CSS.
I learned how to build a navbar, what Normalize.css do, add favicon for a webpage, positioning elements with CSS. All of commits using the bash, fixing my knowledge of the basic git workflow.
